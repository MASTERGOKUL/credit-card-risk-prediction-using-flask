# credit-card-risk-prediction-using-flask
I creeated and deployed a model uding flask
This model Using Five Classification Algorithims namely
<ol>
<li>Logistic regresion </li>
<li>Navie Bayes</li>
<li>Decision Tree</li>
<li> Random Forest</li>
<li>Support Vector Machine</li>
  </ol>

All the Five algrithms are trained and tested
The best accuracy of the above mentioned five algorithms are show in the website 

Here is the sample Output<br>

if we give an input for the respective dataset it shows the output Yes or No if the credit card at risk or not
