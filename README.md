# credit-card-risk-prediction-using-flask
I creeated and deployed a model uding flask
This model Using Five Classification Algorithims namely
1.Logistic regresion 
2.Navie Bayes
3.Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5.Support Vector Machine

All the Five algrithms are trained and tested
The best accuracy of the above mentioned five algorithms are show in the website 

Here is the sample Output<br>

if we give an input for the respective dataset it shows the output Yes or No if the credit card at risk or not
